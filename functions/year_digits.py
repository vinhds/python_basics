#You might be surprised to know that 2013 is the first year since 1987 with distinct digits.
#The years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 each have distinct digits.
#2012 does not have distinct digits, since the digit 2 is repeated.
#
#Given a year, what is the next year with distinct digits?
#Input Specification
#
#The input consists of one integer Y ( 0 â‰¤ Y â‰¤ 10 000 ), representing the starting year.
#Output Specification
#
#The output will be the single integer D , which is the next year after Y with distinct digits.
