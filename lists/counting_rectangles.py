#While playing in his favourite text editor, Daniel decided to draw a picture that was N characters high and M characters wide.
#The picture consists solely of characters . and * such that characters * form some non-overlapping rectangles.
#The rectangles don't even touch each other on their sides or corners.
#
#Help Daniel count the number of rectangles drawn on the picture.
#Input
#
#The first line contains two integers N and M ( 1 ≤ N , M ≤ 100 ) from task description.
#
#Each of the next N lines contains M characters . or * which represent the picture that Daniel drew.
#Output
#
#In a single line you should output the number of rectangles on the picture.
#Scoring
#
#In the test cases worth a total of 20 % of the points, all rectangles will consist of a single * character.
#
#In the test cases worth additional 30 % of the points, it will hold N = 1 .
