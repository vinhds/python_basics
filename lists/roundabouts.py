#Input Specification
#
#The standard input will contain 10 datasets. Each dataset begins with an integer N ( 2 ≤ N ≤ 700 ) , the number of routes.
#The next N lines each contain a series of integers describing a route.
#
#The first integer of each route description is the ID for the route. The second integer R ( 1 ≤ R ≤ 70 )
#is the number of roundabouts along the route. R integers follow which describe the diameter D ( 1 ≤ D ≤ 70 000 )
#of each roundabout along the route.
#Output Specification
#
#For each dataset, output the minimum roundabout diameter along a route followed by a brace-enclosed,
#sorted list of route IDs for the routes that could cause issues.
